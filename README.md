# Project In Progress - Learning and Building

This project is a work in progress, a reflection of my dedication to continuous learning and skill-building in the realm of frontend development.

- **Purpose:** Developed during my spare time, this app serves as my personal initiative to stay updated with the latest frontend technologies.

- **Solo Design and Development:** I am both the designer and developer of this project, using Figma for design and Next.js with Tailwind CSS for development.

- **Continuous Improvement:** While the app may not be published or complete, it demonstrates my commitment to self-improvement and my passion for building and learning, even outside traditional work environments.
